    Hello, my name is Brian Jiang. I am a senior at Mizzou studying Information Technology. I am taking 18 credit hours this semester. I am looking forward to taking the course this fall. I am from Columbia, Missouri. I had previous web application development experience in the spring of last year. I learned the front end languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with the back end languages like AJAX and PHP. My expectations for this course is to expand my knowledge on web design and development and create websites that are unique. Web designers are essential for all the companies in the industry. My hope for the gained web development skills is to make websites understandable to other users. My favorite hobby is playing video games. Video games got me into Information Technology as a major. I like to ride my bike and take walks during my free time.
