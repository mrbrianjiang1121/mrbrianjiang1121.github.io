        <h2>Welcome to my website! Please enjoy the content about my background and skills!</h2>
        
        <p>The purpose of this website is to talk about my background, where I will be sharing about where I am currently at with my education and work experience during my time as a student at Mizzou. I will have projects attached to the website that I have created in the past during my information technology courses along with descriptions of what are the projects that I have created are about along with what I currently do with my work experience. My goal for creating this website is to provide creativity by showing off the required skills for jobs I want to pursue in that I have achieved during my time at Mizzou by attaching my projects that show future employers that I have the knowledge to get hired for the careers that I would like to pursue in along with the accomplishments and skills that I have earned that will be useful for my future.</p>
