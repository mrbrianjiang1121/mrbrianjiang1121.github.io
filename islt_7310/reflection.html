        <p class="tab firstStyle">Wireless security is where you prevent users who do not have rights to connect to the internet with wireless networks. Wireless networks are the most flexible option for many users, but there are still problems that occur with the wireless networks. Users who do not have rights to connect to the internet may try to hack into the routers by grabbing the password in order to gain access to the wireless network. There is always a chance of your wireless network being compromised. Taking precautions of wireless networks are important to keep your network and data safe. </p>
        
        <p class="tab indent">There have been many issues regarding the security of operating systems on computers. The Linux Operating System is the most secure operating system that exists but there are still issues with the Linux Operating System. These issues occur when hackers use tools to find vulnerabilities in Linux based applications, software and networks. Security issues must be solved by having the ability to investigate what’s going on with the operating system’s security. Detection, Prevention and Correction are the common tools to resolve the security issues.</p>
        
        <p class="tab indent">Customer Service in Information Technology is one of the most important skills for getting an Information Technology Career. There will always be users that will experience issues with their computers whether it’s software or hardware related. This experience gives me the opportunity to solve real world problems related to what issues are happening with each computer system and how they can be resolved. I do this by identifying the issue, make plans to respond to the issues and seeing if the solutions work. Before I get notified on who needs help, it’s important to do some research before proceeding with the task.This will make customers happy again once the problems are resolved.</p>
        
        <p class="tab indent">Teaching assistants are needed for each course that is offered at every university. Teaching assistants are given the opportunity to assist students regarding what their questions are with an assignment or topic or if they have any issues with something. They will be able to expand their learning from when they previously took the course before they are asked to assist in that specific course. The more they help, the better they understand the topics that they’ll need to know for the job they want to pursue in. Assisting the students will make them happy about what they are learning about so the students will have the motivation to keep learning about the topics they are interested in.</p>
